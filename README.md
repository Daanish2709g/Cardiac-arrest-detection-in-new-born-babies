In this project, i developed a Cardiac Machine Learning Model (CMLM) for early detection of cardiac arrest in newborns within a Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU). The approach began with collecting detailed clinical and demographic data from CICU records, including vital signs and patient information. Data preprocessing involved cleaning, encoding, and normalizing data to prepare it for model training. We employed various classification algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes to build and evaluate predictive models. Our methodology included splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, tuning model parameters, and handling imbalanced data using techniques like SMOTE. The objective was to create a reliable model that can identify subtle patterns indicative of cardiac arrest, enabling timely intervention and improving patient outcomes in neonatal care.
